# Lab: Parentheses Checker

A common problem in many aspects of programming is data validation. For example, we may want to ensure that any date entered by a user is in a specific format or that names are capitalised correctly. In this lab, we're going to check that all parentheses are matched correctly.


## MVP

We've provided some tests which cover different combinations of parentheses `()` in a String. Create a class with a method that verifies all parentheses are paired correctly.

Hint: try using a Stack to keep track of the parentheses as you find them

## Extension

Remove the `@Ignore` annotations from our second block of tests and modify your method to check for brackets `[]`, braces `{}` and angle brackets `<>`.

## Further Extension

Write tests and modify your method to check for different types of quotation mark: `""` and `''`
